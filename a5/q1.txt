The statues are stuck in livelock. None of the angels are holding and waiting on some resource, but instead they are stuck on a indefinite loop of you go first. Denoting the angels by their position(N, S, E, W) and suppose the angels can see both in front of them and the statues on their left and right. If we apply the cardboard around N, blocking them from S, E, W it can turn around. Then we apply put the cardboard around S to block it from W E allowing it to turn around. Finally we place another cardboard between W E. Now all 4 angels are free :)
